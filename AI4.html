        <h2><strong>What is Game Theory?</strong></h2>
        <p>Game Theory is the study of strategic interactions between individuals or groups, where the outcome for each participant depends on the decisions made by all involved. It provides a framework for understanding and analyzing situations where the choices of different players affect each other, often in competitive environments.

           <br> Game theory is used across a wide range of disciplines, including economics, political science, psychology, biology, and computer science, to study decision-making, conflict resolution, and cooperation. </p>

        <h2>Main Branches of Game Theory</h2>

                <h3>Cooperative Game Theory</h3>
                <p>Cooperative Game Theory explores situations where players, rather than competing individually, can form alliances or coalitions to achieve a common objective. This theory focuses on how groups of players work together to maximize the collective payoff, and how that payoff is distributed among the group. The key difference from non-cooperative game theory is that binding agreements and negotiation are possible, allowing for collaboration. </p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>In a business negotiation, companies may work together to reach a mutually beneficial deal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flow-item">
                <h3>Non-Cooperative Game Theory</h3>
                <p>In Non-Cooperative Game Theory, players act independently, making decisions based on their own interests, without forming coalitions or making binding agreements. Each player attempts to maximize their own payoff, anticipating that other players are doing the same. This leads to strategic decision-making, where each player's actions directly impact the outcomes for others.Centers on individual players and their strategies to achieve their objectives, often in competition with others.</p>
                <h4>Example:</h4>
                <p>The Prisoner’s Dilemma, where two individuals may either cooperate or betray each other for their own gain.</p>

        <h1>Detailed Explanation of Game Theory Branches</h1>

        <h2>Cooperative Game Theory</h2>
        <p>In cooperative games, players form alliances to improve their collective payoff. Unlike non-cooperative games, agreements are enforceable, and strategies revolve around sharing the benefits among participants.</p>
        <h4>Real-Life Example: Cartel Formation</h4>
        <p>Cartels, such as OPEC, work together to manipulate market conditions. By limiting supply, they can raise prices and increase profits for all members. This is an example of cooperative game theory in practice.</p>

        <h2>Non-Cooperative Game Theory</h2>
        <p>In non-cooperative games, each player seeks to maximize their own utility without collaborating with others. The game focuses on predicting players' strategies when there is a conflict of interest.</p>
        <h4>Real-Life Example: Prisoner’s Dilemma</h4>
        <p>In this scenario, two criminals are arrested and kept apart. They can either confess or stay silent. The dilemma occurs because the best personal outcome arises from betraying the other, even though mutual cooperation would lead to a better outcome for both.</p>
